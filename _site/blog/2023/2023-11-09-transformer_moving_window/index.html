<p>This research means to discover the power of transformer in dealing with time series data, for instance traffic flow, with a dynamic time window. Transformer with multihead self-attention mechanism is well-suited for the task like traffic prediction  as it can weight the importance of various aspects in the traffic data sequence, capturing both long-term dependencies and short-term patterns. Compared to the LSTM, the transformer owns the power of parallelization, which is more efficient when facing a large dataset. And it can capture the dependencies better with long sequences. However, the transformer with fixed-length context window may have trouble dealing with the real-time data due to the heavy computation. Hence, this research means to figure out a novel method of using a dynamic window to deal with the long sequance time-series data of transformer using traffic data, discoving a better prediction model for traffic flow.</p>

<!-- ## Images and Figures

Its generally a better idea to avoid linking to images hosted elsewhere - links can break and you
might face losing important information in your blog post.
To include images in your submission in this way, you must do something like the following:

```markdown
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2022-12-01-distill-example/iclr.png" class="img-fluid" %}
```

which results in the following image:

<figure>

  <picture>
    
    <source 
        class="responsive-img-srcset"
        media="(max-width: 480px)" 
        srcset="/staging/assets/img/2022-12-01-distill-example/iclr-480.webp"
      />
    <source 
        class="responsive-img-srcset"
        media="(max-width: 800px)" 
        srcset="/staging/assets/img/2022-12-01-distill-example/iclr-800.webp"
      />
    <source 
        class="responsive-img-srcset"
        media="(max-width: 1400px)" 
        srcset="/staging/assets/img/2022-12-01-distill-example/iclr-1400.webp"
      />
    

    <!-- Fallback to the original file -->
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;img 
  src="/staging/assets/img/2022-12-01-distill-example/iclr.png"
  class="img-fluid"  
  width="auto" 
  height="auto" 
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
  onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"
/&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>&lt;/picture&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<!-- Here's how you could embed interactive figures that have been exported as HTML files.
Note that we will be using plotly for this demo, but anything built off of HTML should work
(**no extra javascript is allowed!**).
All that's required is for you to export your figure into HTML format, and make sure that the file
exists in the `assets/html/[SUBMISSION NAME]/` directory in this repository's root directory.
To embed it into any page, simply insert the following code anywhere into your page.

```markdown
{% include [FIGURE_NAME].html %} 
```

For example, the following code can be used to generate the figure underneath it. -->

<!-- ```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv')

fig = px.density_mapbox(
    df, lat='Latitude', lon='Longitude', z='Magnitude', radius=10,
    center=dict(lat=0, lon=180), zoom=0, mapbox_style="stamen-terrain")
fig.show()

fig.write_html('./assets/html/2022-12-01-distill-example/plotly_demo_1.html')
```

And then include it with the following:

```html
<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ 'assets/html/2022-12-01-distill-example/plotly_demo_1.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="600px" width="100%"></iframe>
</div>
```

Voila!

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="/staging/assets/html/2022-12-01-distill-example/plotly_demo_1.html" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="600px" width="100%"></iframe>
</div> -->

<!-- ## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

<!-- ## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote> -->

## Code Blocks

This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:


{% highlight c++ linenos %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}


The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers. You can try toggling it on or off yourself below:


<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="err">\</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[])</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">"input a string: "</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">getline</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cin</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">();</span>

    <span class="n">charArray</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="o">++</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">){</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<!-- ## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div> -->

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*. -->
