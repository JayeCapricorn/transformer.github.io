<p>This research means to discover the power of transformer in dealing with time series data, for instance traffic flow. Transformer with multihead self-attention mechanism is well-suited for the task like traffic prediction as it can weight the importance of various aspects in the traffic data sequence, capturing both long-term dependencies and short-term patterns. Compared to the LSTM, the transformer owns the power of parallelization, which is more efficient when facing a large dataset. And it can capture the dependencies better with long sequences. However, the transformer may have trouble dealing with the long sequence time-series data due to the heavy computation. Hence, this research means to figure out a method to deal with this problem using traffic data, discoving a better prediction model for traffic flow. There are several potential ways to explore: periodicity capture; information distillation.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h2>
<p>The time series data processing and prediction are usually conducted with RNN and LSTM. In the case of traffic prediction, CNN and GNN are combined for efficiently capturing spatial and temporal information. And LSTM is widely used as its better performance on capturing temporal dependencies. While recent studies have propsed to replace RNNs with Transformer architecture as it is more efficient and able to capture sequantial dependency. However, the model is inapplicable when facing long sequence time data due to quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and in- herent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. <d-cite key="Zhou_Zhang_Peng_Zhang_Li_Xiong_Zhang_2021"></d-cite> (Zhou et al. 2021)</p>

<p>There are notable models focsing on the less explored and challenging long-term time series forecasting(LTSF) problem, include Log- Trans (Li et al. 2019) (NeurIPS 2019), Informer (Zhou et al. 2021) (AAAI 2021 Best paper), Autoformer (Xu et al. 2021) (NeurIPS 2021), Pyraformer (Liu et al. 2021a) (ICLR 2022 Oral), Triformer (Cirstea et al. 2022) (IJCAI 2022) and the recent FEDformer (Zhou et al. 2022) (ICML 2022). <d-cite key="Zeng_Chen_Zhang_Xu_2023"></d-cite>(Zeng, Ailing et al. 2023)</p>

<p>The Informer model applies ProbSparse self-attention mechanism to let each key to only attend to several dominant queries and then use the distilling operation to deal with the redundance. The operation privileges the superior ones with dominaitng features and make a focused self-attention feature map in the next layer, which trims the inputâ€™s time dimension.<d-cite key="Zhou_Zhang_Peng_Zhang_Li_Xiong_Zhang_2021"></d-cite>(Zhou et al. 2021) Besides, additional position encoding can help the model to understand the periodicity inherented in traffic data, which implies applying the relative or global positioin encoding interms of weeks and days. <d-cite key="https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12644"></d-cite> (Cai et al. 2020)</p>

<!-- ## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow wellâ€‰â€”â€‰the authors are human and itâ€™s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote> -->

## Code Blocks

This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:


{% highlight c++ linenos %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}


The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers. You can try toggling it on or off yourself below:


<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="err">\</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[])</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">"input a string: "</span><span class="p">;</span>

<!-- ## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally youâ€™ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div> -->

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
â‹…â‹…* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
â‹…â‹…1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

â‹…â‹…â‹…You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

â‹…â‹…â‹…To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.â‹…â‹…
â‹…â‹…â‹…Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.â‹…â‹…
â‹…â‹…â‹…(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*. -->
